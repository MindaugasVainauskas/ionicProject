To Do list app project for Ionic mobile app dev. module

#Disclaimer!
This is not a fully fledged application as it is meant to only showcase what I learned over the semester of Mobile Applications development module.
This application is my own work. I did not follow any tutorials to make it, and any research done online for it consisted of only
learning how to do few small bits for this application that I was not sure about.

#Purpose and use of application:
This application is a simple to do list application.
Users enter task list name when creating new task list. For example, "Shopping list", "House chores" etc.
Then by clicking on the name of task list they get taken to subtask page where they can enter tasks 
associated with that task group. Eg. "Milk, Eggs, Bread, Butter" etc.

Subtasks are marked completed by clicking on them to mark the checkbox in the list.

Users can delete individual subtasks or full lists at once by toggling delete button view which enables delete 
button to the left of each subtask/task list.
